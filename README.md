# GameApplication
The app you appears to be a short application/game.
The app you are describing is a weather-based application with additional features. Here's a brief description of the app:

Upon the first launch, the app makes an asynchronous server request to retrieve a true/false response from a specified server. If there are any issues with the server, a fallback response can be provided. The request is performed in a background thread to ensure it doesn't block the main thread.

If the server response is true, the app opens a WebView component with the Google homepage (https://www.google.com). The WebView is configured to enable features such as cookies, caching, and JavaScript. The WebView retains its state even when the screen orientation changes. Additionally, a back button is implemented to navigate backward within the WebView.

If the server response is false, the app opens a unique game. The game can belong to any genre, such as an arcade game implemented using SurfaceView, CustomView, LibGDX, or other frameworks. It could also be a puzzle or brain-teaser game, such as finding a hidden image among others or a matching game. The game should be original and not copied from existing sources, providing a unique gameplay experience.

Furthermore, after the first launch, the app saves the server response information, which can be stored in a local database or storage. Upon subsequent launches, the app opens the corresponding view (WebView or game) that was initially opened, regardless of any changes in the server data.
